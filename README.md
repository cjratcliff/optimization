# Learning Gradient Descent with Synthetic Objectives

Research project to learn generalizable optimizers for neural networks from synthetic objective functions.    


**Prerequisites**
 - TensorFlow    
 - Numpy    


Run main.py to train the optimizer and compare.py to test it against SGD and Adam.
